The repo is the official implementation for the paper: [Automated Optimization Modeling through Expert-Guided Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14410)

## Introduction

Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, current approaches still face limitations, including narrow evaluation scope that only considers optimal values and computational inefficiency due to heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. We present ORThought, a framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through chain-of-thought reasoning to automate OM process.
